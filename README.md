## Description

_This small web app helps the user decide which programming language they should learn first._

## Setup/Installation Instructions

* _Navigate to the main page of the repository (https://github.com/yesthecarlos/language-suggester.git)_
* _Click the large green Code button at the top rightmost corner of the list of files._
* _Click "Use GitHub CLI", then click the clipboard icon._
* _Open Terminal and change the directory to your desired location._

## Feature Plans

* _In this web app (as in real life) astrological signs have no effect on the outcome. However, this question will have a small effect on the outcome in the future._
* _Incorporating the start date into the user's results is proving to be trickier than expected. For now, the start date also has no effect on the outcome._
